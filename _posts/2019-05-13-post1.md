<p>Flutter for web
Flutter for the web is a code-compatible implementation of Flutter that is rendered using standards-based web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With Flutter for web, you can compile existing Flutter code written in Dart into a client experience that can be embedded in the browser and deployed to any web server. You can use all the features of Flutter, and you donâ€™t need a browser plug-in.</p>
